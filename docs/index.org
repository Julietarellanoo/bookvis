Focusing on the exploration of data with visual methods, *Displaying
Time Series, Spatial, and Space-Time Data with R* presents methods and
R code for producing high-quality graphics of time series, spatial,
and space-time data. Practical examples using real-world datasets help
you understand how to apply the methods and code.  The book
illustrates how to display a dataset starting with an easy and direct
approach and progressively adding improvements that involve more
complexity. Each of the book’s three parts is devoted to different
types of data. In each part, the chapters are grouped according to the
various visualization methods or data characteristics.
  
Along with the main graphics from the text, this website offers access
to the datasets used in the examples as well as the full R code. This
combination of freely available code and data enables you to practice
with the methods and modify the code to suit your own needs.
