@BOOK{Ware2008,
  ABSTRACT  = {Increasingly, designers need to present information in ways that aid their audience's thinking process. Fortunately, results from the relatively new science of human visual perception provide valuable guidance. In Visual Thinking for Design, Colin Ware takes what we now know about perception, cognition, and attention and transforms it into concrete advice that designers can directly apply. He demonstrates how designs can be considered as tools for cognition - extensions of the viewer's brain in much the same way that a hammer is an extension of the user's hand. Experienced professional designers and students alike will learn how to maximize the power of the information tools they design for the people who use them. • Presents visual thinking as a complex process that can be supported in every stage using specific design techniques. • Provides practical, task-oriented information for designers and software developers charged with design responsibilities. • Includes hundreds of examples, many in the form of integrated text and full-color diagrams. • Steeped in the principles of “active vision,? which views graphic designs as cognitive tools.},

@ARTICLE{Havre.Hetzler.ea2002,
  ABSTRACT     = {The ThemeRiver visualization depicts thematic variations over time within a large collection of documents. The thematic changes are shown in the context of a time-line and corresponding external events. The focus on temporal thematic change within a context framework allows a user to discern patterns that suggest relationships or trends. For example, the sudden change of thematic strength following an external event may indicate a causal relationship. Such patterns are not readily accessible in other visualizations of the data. We use a river metaphor to convey several key notions. The document collection's time-line, selected thematic content and thematic strength are indicated by the river's directed flow, composition and changing width, respectively. The directed flow from left to right is interpreted as movement through time and the horizontal distance between two points on the river defines a time interval. At any point in time, the vertical distance, or width, of the river indicates the collective strength of the selected themes. Colored "currents" flowing within the river represent individual themes. A current's vertical width narrows or broadens to indicate decreases or increases in the strength of the individual theme},

  ABSTRACT     = {High-performance interaction with scatterplot matrices is a powerful approach to exploratory multivariate data analysis. For a small number of data points, real-time interaction is possible and overplotting is usually not a major problem. When the number of plotted points is large, however, display techniques that deal with overplotting and slow production are important. This article addresses these two problems. Topics include density representation by gray scale or by symbol area, alternatives to brushing, and animation sequences. We also discuss techniques that are generally applicable, including interactive graphical subset selection from any plot in a collection of scatterplots and comparison of scatterplot matrices.},
